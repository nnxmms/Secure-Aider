- Always include `#!/usr/bin/python3` at the top of the python file
- Always type every variable and function e.g. `x: int = 3` and `def sum(x: int, y; int) -> int:`
- Always use docstring to document functions and classes e.g. `:param x: First integer\n:param y: Second integer\n:return int: Sum of x and y`
- Always use clean, simple and structured code
- Never write huge functions, split the logic up into multiple smaller ones instead
- Never write full sentences as comments. Use short comments instead. E.g. Instead of `Summing up the integers x and y` write `Sum of x and y`
- Never write comments behind a line of code, always above
